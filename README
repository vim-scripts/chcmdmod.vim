This script evolved from a mistake that I used to sometimes make. To start a search, instead of using "/", I would sometimes start with ":" and after typing some text realize I am in the wrong mode, so I wrote this plugin to be able to switch between modes without loosing the text that you already typed, but I added more features to it later.

- When you are in one of the :, / or ? modes, switch to a different mode
  by typing ^X/ or ^X: or ^X?.
- While searching you can press ^S to find the next hit, without needing to
  first press <Enter> followed by n or N. You need to have 'incsearch'
  option turned on for this to work. You can mix this with the ^X/ and ^X?
  to reverse the search without needing to press enter and start over.
- While searching using 'incsearch', you can use ^Xw to complete the
  current word (or ^XW for WORD), <S-Right> to fetch one extra character
  from the end of current match position (or <S-Left> from the beginning).
